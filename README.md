Shrtnr API Docs
===============

The API documentation for Shrtnr are provided as an OpenApi 3.0 spec. This repo
also includes a package.json file that will provide a development webserver that
will use the fantastic [RapiDoc](https://mrin9.github.io/RapiDoc/) viewer to
render the spec in a web browser.

These docs are also available at: https://shrtnr.github.io/api-docs

Running Locally
---------------

Assuming Node and NPM are already installed, follow these steps:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local web server and display the url to use to access the
RapiDoc viewer.
